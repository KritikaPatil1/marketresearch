Market Analysis and Insights

Aluminium-extruded Products Market

Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the aluminium-extruded products market will witness a CAGR of 4.22% in the forecast period of 2021-2028. Increased focus of the manufacturers on technological advancements in the aluminium industry and increasing application of aluminium-extruded products by the various end user verticals such as transportation and logistics, building and construction, automotive, electrical and electronics, consumer durables and others are the major factors attributable to the growth of the aluminium-extruded products market.

Aluminium is a metal that possess properties like sustainability, durability, flexibility and tensile strength. This is why aluminium is used for extrusion. Extrusion is a process that enables the production of cross-sectional profile in bulk quantities. The aluminium-extruded products are recyclable in nature. Moreover, these emit minimal harmful gases in the nature.

Increasing demand and value-added aluminium products that are recyclable in nature is the root cause fuelling up the aluminium-extruded products market growth rate. Growth and expansion of automobile industry and other end user verticals is another factor responsible for propelling growth in the aluminium-extruded products market value. Upsurge in the construction activities especially in the developing economies will further create lucrative growth opportunities for the aluminium-extruded products market. Attractive properties offered by aluminium-extruded products such as durability, flexibility, thermal conductivity, ductility, recyclability and malleability will further accelerate the market growth rate.

However, lack of awareness about aluminium-extruded products in the under developing economies will pose a major challenge to the growth rate of this market. High initial investment associated with aluminium-extruded products will further restrict the scope of growth for this market. Substitutes available in the market such as magnesium alloy over aluminium alloy will further derail the market growth rate.
