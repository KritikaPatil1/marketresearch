Low-intensity sweeteners also help to keep the insulin levels unaffected after their ingestion.

The major growing factor towards low intensity sweeteners market is the growing consumer inclination towards low calorie food.

Moreover, the rising demand for healthy food products, development of the product at a very low price and beverages containing low-sugar content also serves as foremost drivers for increasing the demand for low intensity sweeteners market at a global level. In addition, the growing preferences for the sugar substitutes and rapid product development activities for the sugar substitutes are also lifting the growth of the low intensity sweeteners market.
